# Interactive Analysis of College Attendance Systems with AI Tools

This project is an interactive, single-page web application that provides a comprehensive analysis of attendance systems used in Indian engineering colleges. It visualizes data on system adoption and effectiveness, compares different attendance-taking methods, and presents case studies from various institutions. 

The standout feature is a suite of AI-powered tools, built using the Google Gemini API, designed to assist administrators, faculty, and students with common attendance-related challenges.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Uses `Chart.js` to display the adoption rates of different systems and their effectiveness in reducing proxy attendance.
*   **Methods Comparison:** A detailed breakdown of various attendance methods (Manual, Biometric, QR Code, Facial Recognition) with their pros, cons, and vulnerability to "proxy" attendance.
*   **Case Studies:** Presents real-world examples and trends from institutions like IITs, NITs, and other top state universities.
*   **AI-Powered Attendance Suite (Powered by Gemini):**
    *   **Policy Drafter:** An administrative tool to automatically generate formal attendance policy notices.
    *   **System Auditor:** A security tool that analyzes a described attendance process to identify potential loopholes.
    *   **Excuse Validator:** A tool for faculty to analyze the genuineness of student excuses and generate a reply.
    *   **Recovery Planner:** A tool for students to calculate the required number of classes they need to attend to meet the minimum attendance criteria.
